## Project Overview

PlanMyTrip is a travel tech company specializing in internet related services in hotel and lodging. The purpose of this project is to collect data for customers via a search page that customers will be able to filter to their preferences in order to find their ideal hotel. "Ideal hotel" is classified by (1) being within a given range of latitude and longitude and(2)providing the right kind of weather for the client. We would also like to predict the best time of year for users to plan their vacation.
