## Project Overview

PlanMyTrip is a travel tech company specializing in internet related services in hotel and lodging. The purpose of this project is to collect data for customers via a search page that customers will be able to filter to their preferences in order to find their ideal hotel. "Ideal hotel" is classified by (1) being within a given range of latitude and longitude and(2)providing the right kind of weather for the client. The final result is a display of the weather description, city, country, and maximum temperature for potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. To do this, the weather data has been collected via OpenWeatherMap API calls, and filtered to the customers' preferences based on their input. From the list of potential travel destinations, I have chosen four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
